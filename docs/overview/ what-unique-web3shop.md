- **Shop running on blockchain**: 
User truly own your store’s data and value instead of hosting it on Amazon, Alibaba and other centralized E-Commerce platforms. All the product information on the shop is stored in the blockchain and is truly owned by you. The shop data is independent of the platform, and you do not need to rely on any platform. Any application that reads your store smart contract can help you display your store.

- **Asset-based algorithms:**
Web3Shop recommends the designs and shops based on the NFT assets in the user’s wallet. The designer chooses a NFT IP to start a derivative design, the user who owns the NFT collection can see the designer's work. We match buyers and sellers in a more accurate and cheaper way without misusing the user's data

- **Save the core value of the commodities in design NFT**:
You can deliver your design inspiration, design drawings, value, and rights to users through design NFT as an information carrier. Through design NFT, you  can give users more rights and benefits to own the value than physical objects carry.

- **Zero Inventory**:
Web3Shop separates design and production process, and purchase of a design occurs before production. Only the purchased design needs to be produced by the manufacturer. Designers can determine user preferences with minimal cost and thus adjust the design quickly.
